# Conway's Game of Life
This project is a Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The game is a cellular automaton simulation that demonstrates the concept of emergent complexity through the interaction of simple rules and a complex system of cells.

## Rules of the Game
The game is played on a grid of cells, where each cell can either be alive or dead. The cells are updated in each iteration of the game according to the following rules:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Implementation Details
The game is implemented using Java and utilizes a two-dimensional array to represent the game board. The game board is initialized randomly or can be loaded from a file, and the game progresses through each iteration by updating the state of each cell based on its neighbors according to the rules listed above. 

## Getting Started
To play the game, download the project files and run the application.
